MODEL DISCUSSION AND RELATIONSHIPS FOR AGRO-Connect platform

1.User Model (Central Entity)
- Represents all types of users: Farmers, Buyers, Transporters, Admins
- Holds common fields such as name, email, phone , address , role , language preference.
- Acts as the base user entity, linked with specific profiles based on role

ROLE-BASED PROFILE
- Farmer -> FarmerProfile(Farm details, certifications)
- Buyer -> BuyerProfile( Business info, PAN number)
- Transporter - > TransporterProfile(Vehicle, license, capacity)

This design helps to separate concerns and store role-specific info without cluttering the main User table

2. PRODUCT MODEL
- Owned by a farmer (UserID foreign key pointing to a User with role "farmer")
- Stores multilingual field (Nepali & English names/descriptions) for localization
- Includes product details such as category , quantity, pricing, availiablilty period.
- Supports images for rich product listing

3. Translation Model
- Helps store multiple translations for product fields
- Links to product via ProductID.
- Allows flexible multilingual support beyond basic Nepali and English fields

4. OFFER MODEL
- Created by Buyers(BuyerID) on Product
- Buyer offers a price and quantity to buy
- Includes offer status (pending, accepted, rejected)
- Has a proposed pickup date.

This allows dynamic negotiation between buyer and farmer before finilazing
an order.

5. ORDER MODEL
- Represents confirmed purchase.
- Links to an accepted Offer( OfferID)
- Connects Farmer, Buyer, and Product.
- Tracks order status (processing, completed, canceled)
This is the transactional core where actual business happens.

6 . TRANSPORTSCHEDULE MODEL
- Linked to Transporter( TransporterID) AND ORDER (orderID)
- Manages logistics: vehicle, route( from-to) scheduled date and status
- Enables integrated transport management matching orders to transporters.

7. Review Model
- Users can review each other based on transactions (linked with OrderID)
- Helps maintain trust in the ecosystem ( Farmers, buyers, transporters)
- Rating and comments improve transparency.

8 NOTIFICATION MODEL
- Pushes system or event-based notifications to users.
- Keeps users informed of new offers, order status changes, transport updates, etc.


9 TRANSACTION MODEL
- Logs payment details linked to Orders
- Support payment method tracking (cash, digital wallets eSewa, Khalti).
- Ensures auditability and financial reconciliation

Relationships Summary (ER style)
Entity A	Relationship	Entity B	           Notes
User	     1:N	      FarmerProfile	         One farmer profile per user
User	     1:N	      BuyerProfile	        One buyer profile per user
User	     1:N	      TransporterProfile	One transporter profile per user
User (Farmer)1:N	      Product	          Farmer owns multiple products
Product	     1:N	      Translation	     Product can have multiple translations
Buyer (User) 1:N	      Offer	             Buyer can make multiple offers
Offer	     1:1	      Order	             One offer leads to one order
Order	     1:1	TransportSchedule	      Each order can have one transport schedule
Order	     1:N	Review	                 Multiple reviews possible (buyer/farmer/transporter feedback)
User	     1:N	Notification	         Users receive multiple notifications
Order	     1:1	Transaction	             Each order linked to a payment transaction


WHY THIS MODEL SUITS NEPAL'S SCENARION?
- Multilingual support ensures wider accessibility (Nepali and English)
Role-specific profiles handle distinct user needs (farmers vs buyers vs transporters).

Transport scheduling reflects Nepal‚Äôs complex terrain and transport challenges.

Offers before orders allow negotiation, common in local marketplaces.

Payment tracking allows integration with popular Nepalese payment gateways.

Review system builds trust in a community-based agriculture market.

Notification system keeps all parties up to date in a timely manner.
